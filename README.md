# Exploring_Data_Engineering
<p>
  Taking 30 days to explore different aspects of data engineering and learning on the way.<br>
  Inspired by Machine Learning Community posts on LinkedIn by Tanishq Soni

<p>
  Day 1:<br>
  Knowledge Gain:<br>
  Data Engineering is a field that<br>
  1. collects raw data from APIs, sensors<br>
  2. saves data in data warehouses or data lakes<br>
  3. undergo some transformations like cleaning, structuring<br>
  4. deliver it to be used otherwise in machine learning models, dashboards
</p>
<p>
  Code:<br>
  Extracting data from an API, converting the json to DataFrame, select required columns and save it in a csv file.
</p>

  Day 2:<br>
  Knowledge Gain:<br>
  Difference between Data Engineer, Analyst and Scientist <br>
  1. Data Engineers collect and get data ready to be used<br>
  2. Data Analyst use clean data to analyse and gain valuable insights<br>
  3. Data Scientist adds some intelligence to the data
</p>
<p>
  Code:<br>
  Clean data, draw analysis and predict using Logistic Regression to predict for a value
