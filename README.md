# Exploring_Data_Engineering
Taking 30 days to explore different aspects of data engineering and learning on the way. 
Inspired by Machine Learning Community posts on LinkedIn by Tanishq Soni

Day 1:
Knowledge Gain: 
Data Engineering is a field that 
1. collects raw data from APIs, sensors
2. saves data in data warehouses or data lakes
3. undergo some transformations like cleaning, structuring
4. deliver it to be used otherwise in machine learning models, dashboards

Code:
Extracting data from an API, converting the json to DataFrame, select required columns and save it in a csv file.
